/**
 * <p>Run a module in a Sodacan runtime. The runtime is the same as if run within an agent but
 * it differs in that there is no coordination with other runners of this module. In other words,
 * the same module could be running more than one place at the same time so this is a no-no in a production
 * environment. But it is useful when testing a new module. </p>
 * <p>A module run in this way continues until the CLI exits or until the <code>follow stop</code> command is used to stop it.
 * While the module is running, you can publish messages and change the clock which the module will respond to.</p>
